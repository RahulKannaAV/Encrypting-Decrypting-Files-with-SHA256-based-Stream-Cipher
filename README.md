# Encrypting-Decrypting-Files-with-SHA256-based-Stream-Cipher 

### Parallelizing the block formation process with OpenMP, MPI and CUDA implementations in C++
This uses SHA-256 to generate a keystream so that we can encrypt and decrypt the same file.
We parallelize only the block formation aspect of this algorithm so that encryption and decryption process takes less time for bulk files.
